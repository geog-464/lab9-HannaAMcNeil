			This is inside basic html container

			<p>2. The JS script is loaded at the end of the htlm file so that the rest of the webpage can load first <br>
			and the user doesnt have to look at a blank screen while the js script loads.</p>
			<p>3. The onload method loads the function only when the rest of the page has loaded, again to load the page faster <br>
			(although I'm not sure this is nessisary if the JS script is already at the bottem of the html file and run at the end anyway ikd)</p>
			<p>4. The variable cityPop is an object and it contains properties (strings and intergers) in a key-value pair format. <br>
				cityPop looks like a python ditionary object and the key-value pair objects seem to be strings and integres</p>
